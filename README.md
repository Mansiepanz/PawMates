# PawMates
A social app for pet owners to discover nearby fellow pet parents and arrange pet playdates. Built with React and Tailwind CSS.
As part of the PawMates project, I leveraged V0.dev to generate both high-fidelity mockups and developer-ready front-end code through prompt engineering. This allowed me to iterate quickly on nostalgic UI styles (inspired by Tamagotchi as a personal preference) and structure screens with real components using TailwindCSS, pixel fonts, and animation classes.
While the PawMates app was designed to feel playful and visual-first, it was also rendered with developer-ready code using V0.dev. The underlying architecture is built using React and TailwindCSS, enriched with custom fonts, colour tokens, and animation utilities. This enabled a clean separation of layout, theming, and content logic, all reflective of the Tamagotchi-inspired design system.
As a product manager who doesn’t come from a traditional coding background, working with V0.dev has helped me better understand how design decisions translate into component logic, data types, and UI state. Exploring low-code tools and reading through the actual code has made me more fluent when collaborating with engineers, and given me greater appreciation for front-end architecture ☺️
